Kamon Telemetry is a set of libraries for instrumenting applications running on the JVM. With Kamon Telemetry you can 
collect metrics, propagate context across threads and services, and get distributed traces automatically. The best way 
to get started is following our [installation guides](https://kamon.io/get-started/) and taking it from there. Have fun 
with Kamon!
